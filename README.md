## #KnowYourCity Campaign [Code4SierraLeone]
=============================================


**This branch mainly contains the main logic of the app that handles the Administrative Management part and can be used to both map the data as well manipulate and manage the data.**

Know Your City Campaign aims at mapping all the amenities within Informal Settlement areas in Freetown, Sierra Leone, so as to help the occupants get help in the case of a disaster in the regions. The mapping will give details in terms of directions and distance from their current locations as well as the services offered in those areas.


For the User Interface Design and Logic Implementation, I have used the following resources(please refer to the documentation(`to come`) for further details on each)
* `jQuery`
* `HTML` & `LessCSS`
* `Google Maps Javascript API v3`
* `JavaScript`
* `Golang` (Local server taste runs
* `Firebase`(Authentication and Realtime Database)

### Quick Instructions

1. To view the current user interface designs just run the files on the `templates directory` on your local server. You can as well set up the `$GOPATH` and run the `main.go` server found here[This is under construction and will be documented by next week].
2. The data being rendered on the User interface at the moment are dummy data, and not real especially on the Map.
